## ðŸ’» What this simple app does: 
This single-file web app lets you input a stock ticker and pulls its latest P/E from FMPâ€™s Financial Ratios API. It also fetches sector P/E values from the Sector PE Snapshot for a chosen date and exchange, and it auto-detects the companyâ€™s sector via the profile endpoint when possible. The UI displays key figures (company P/E, sector P/E, and the percentage difference), simple comparison bars, and a clear verdict: potentially undervalued, overvalued, or roughly in line (Â±10%). Thereâ€™s a dark, responsive layout with a loading spinner, and it safely stores your key/date/exchange in localStorage for convenience (you can reset anytime).  Remember to replace the placeholder with your own custom FMP API key before fetching data.
